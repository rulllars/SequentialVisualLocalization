# Sequential Localization
**Authors:** Erik Stenborg, Torsten Sattler and [Lars Hammarstrand](https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/lars-hammarstrand.aspx).

This repository consist of a set of tools to perform sequential visual localization of a moving camera platform (multi-camera rig) using odometry and a fixed map. The tool set includes 2 set of tools. The first is [Ä¹ocSLAM](LocSLAM/) which is a hybrid SLAM system based on [ORB_SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) that computes a precise platform (body) trajectory in relation to a pre-built fixed map using images from a set of cameras, odometry, and fixed map matches (local features). The second is a set of [Matlab scripts](CoarseLocFilters/) to perform coarse localization using odometry and coarse positioning information from either GPS or image retrieval, e.g. DenseVLAD. Please view the specific sub-repository for more details regarding each tool.

# 2. Prerequisites
We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 16.04**, and **20.04**, but it should be easy to compile/run on other platforms.
